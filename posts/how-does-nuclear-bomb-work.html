                <h1>How does nuclear bomb work?</h1>
                <p id="recentDesc">
                    In decades after the Second World War, nuclear bombs represented a growing threat to human civilisation. Almost all of us are aware of their destructive power, despite being used only twice in combat, but not many people know why this is and how they work. That is what we will try to explain in this article.

            <h2>Atom</h2>
            It is known that all matter is made out of <b>atoms</b>, and atoms themselves out of three different kinds of subatomic
            particles - protons (with positive electrical charge), neutrons (with neutral charge), and electrons (negatively charged). 
            Protons and neutrons are situated together in the centre of an atom - nucleus, while electrons surround them forming a 
            so-called "electron cloud". Radiation, which is one of the main components of a nuclear explosion, is a consequence of 
            various processes in the atom.

            <h2>Fission and fusion</h2>
            Processes which emit radiation are fission and fusion. <br>
            <b>Fission</b> is achieved by shooting a neutron into a heavy atom, which becomes unstable and splits into two 
            smaller atoms. It also releases electromagnetic radiation and a couple of neutrons, that start a chain reaction upon 
            hitting newly formed atoms. The most commonly used elements for fission are Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239 because they 
            are the easiest to initiate and control.

        <article>
            <b>Fusion</b> is a reversed process to fission - two light atoms are collided, forming a heavier one, thereby 
            releasing massive amounts of energy. Elements used for nuclear fusion are usually hydrogen isotopes deuterium 
            and tritium since they are light and highly reactive.

            <h2>Bomb structure</h2>
            Modern nuclear bomb, called hydrogen bomb, uses a combination of conventional explosives, fission and fusion, for the 
            most effective detonation. When dropped, the <b>primary stage</b> starts. Conventional explosives in the bomb cause 
            uranium and plutonium (in the form of a two-layer sphere) to start fission. Released heat and pressure cause the 
            <b>secondary stage</b>, in which hydrogen isotopes fuse. Both stages release massive amounts of energy in the form 
            of radiation, and temperatures in the place of detonation reach those in the centre of the Sun.

            <h2>Nuclear detonation consequences</h2>
            The worst consequence of the nuclear bomb detonation is its effect on people, due to emitted radiation. It is found in 
            three forms: alpha, beta and gamma radiation. <br>
            <b>Alpha radiation</b> is made of alpha particles - helium atoms. These particles can not penetrate through clothes, 
            so they are not able to cause serious damage to the organism. <br>
            <b>Beta radiation</b> is made of beta particles - electrons. These can penetrate clothes and skin, but not walls and 
            other thicker objects, and can be used in medicine for treating tumours. <br>
            <b>Gamma radiation</b> is made of protons. It can penetrate through most materials and cause serious damage to living 
            organisms, by changing DNA and causing cancer. <br><br>

            In 1980, during the Cold War, scientists introduced us to the possible outcome of a large-scale nuclear war - 
            "nuclear winter". In that scenario, so many bombs would be dropped that radioactive clouds of dust would cover 
            the atmosphere, leading to a drop in surface temperature and radioactive fallout (rain from radioactive clouds) 
            which would poison water. These effects would certainly cause the extinction of many species, possibly including humans.
