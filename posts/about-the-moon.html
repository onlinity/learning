                <h1>The Moon</h1>
                <p id="recentDesc">
                    The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, the brightest object in night sky, the only place in the universe (except the Earth) where humans have set foot, and the subject of the large amount of research.                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <article>
            <h2>Formation</h2>
            Scientists are not completely sure what caused creation of the Moon, but 
            the leading theory suggests that 4.5 billion years ago Mars-sized body collided with 
            Earth, sending debris in the orbit around it. Within around 100 million years, 
            molten rocks finally crystallized, creating our natural satelite 384,000km (239,000mi) away.

            <h2>Movement</h2>
            The Moon is rotating, revolving around the Earth, and with Earth around the Sun at the 
            same time. As its rotation rate and rate of revolving around the Earth are same, 
            we always face the same side of it. That <b>synchronous rotation</b> causes what we call "phases". 
            When the side we face is completely illuminated by the Sun, it's a "full moon", and when that is 
            the case with the opposite side, it's a "new moon".

            <h2>Structure and surface</h2>
            Structure of the Moon is divided into three parts: <b>core</b>, <b>mantle</b> and <b>crust</b>. <br>
            The core is primarily made of iron, both in solid and liquid state. The mantle contains minerals, 
            like olivine and pyroxene, made of magnesium, iron, silicon and oxygen. The top layer, crust, is similar 
            to the mantle, but also contains aluminium, titanium, uranium, thorium, potassium and hydrogen. <br><br>
            As the Moon has no atmosphere, it is constantly exposed to the strikes that leave numerous craters. One 
            of the biggest is Tycho crater, with 85km (52mi) in width. Those strikes are the reason why the surface is 
            covered with dust. <br>
            Another consequence of lack of atmosphere is range of temperatures on the surface, a lot bigger than on Earth. 
            It reaches 127°C (260°F) on the sunny side, and -173°C (-280°F) on the dark side.

            <h2>Some interesting facts:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Our natural satellite was called "The Moon" because at the time we had not found any other moons. First ones were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610.</li>
                <li>The Moon is the second densest satellite, after Jupiter's satellite Io.</li>
                <li>The Moon is moving around 3.8cm away from the Earth every year.</li>
            </ul>
